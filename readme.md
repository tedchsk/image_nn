# A Deeper Look into Dense Shortcut Nets

DenseNets have demonstrated superior performance on vision tasks, but have a
much higher memory footprint than ResNets. DSNets claim to have solved this
trade-off. In this paper, we will take a deeper look at this architecture and compare
it side-by-side to the other two in multiple experiments. We find that DSNets are
indeed signficantly better than ResNets, but only if the model size is large enough.
We also test the effect of different hyperparameters and provide a guideline on
when to use each model based on memory and time requirements.

## Installation
- Make sure you have conda in your local machine, then follow the steps below.
- Make sure you are in the project root directory.

```bash
# create conda envirnoment from environment.yml
conda env create --name image_nn --file environment.yml
# Activate the created environment
conda activate image_nn
```
Now, install pytorch version 1.11. If you are on a linux-based machine with CUDA 11.3, you can use:
```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
```

And finally run the following to test your installation:
```bash
# Set current project path as executable so that conda environment uses the project code.
pip install -e .
# All tests should passed if the environment installation is complete.
pytest 
```

## Usage 

After successfully setting up python environment, use this command to start the training.

```bash
python scripts/main.py
```

![train sample](images/code_train_sample.png)

Use this command to see the summary of losses and accuracies of all the models. The training process logs the training once each model finishes the training, so all the finished training models will be shown here.

```bash
python scripts/report.py
```

## Reproducing Experiments

To reproduce the experiments, you can run the files inside the `experiments` folder. Each experiment has its own corresponding file.

The only exception is experiment 4.5 which was hard to put inside a single python file as the process to produce the results required multiple runs and reading things from the logs. You can find the notebook used for experiment 4.5 [here](notebooks/find_model_mem_use_params.ipynb).
